# Improvement Plan for Synthetic Errands Scheduler

## Completed Tasks

1. Implement Configuration Management
   - Created config.yaml file to store configurable parameters
   - Implemented utils/config_manager.py to manage configuration loading and access
   - Updated constants.py to use the new configuration management system

2. Use Enum for Errand Types
   - Defined ErrandType enum in constants.py
   - Updated all references to errand types throughout the codebase to use the new Enum

3. Implement Proper Logging
   - Replaced print statements with logging calls throughout the project
   - Configured logging in main.py with appropriate log levels and output formats
   - Implemented consistent use of different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

4. Enhance Error Handling
   - Added try-except blocks for potential error scenarios in main.py and initial_scheduler.py
   - Implemented custom exceptions (ProblemGenerationError, SchedulingError, InitialSchedulingError)
   - Updated error handling in main module and initial scheduler

5. Enhance Unit Tests
   - Updated test suite to use ErrandType enum
   - Added new test cases for error handling scenarios in initial_scheduler.py
   - Improved test coverage for edge cases and error scenarios

6. Use Type Hinting
   - Added type hints to all function definitions and variable declarations throughout the codebase
   - Implemented type hints in core modules (models, utils, algorithms)
   - Extended type hinting to all parts of the codebase, including tests and GUI components

7. Improve Code Organization
   - Broke down large functions in optimizer.py into smaller, more focused functions
   - Moved problem generation logic from main.py to utils/problem_generator.py
   - Separated CLI functionality in main.py into its own module (cli_interface.py)

8. Improve Modularity of main.py
   - Created a separate module for CLI functionality (cli_interface.py)
   - Updated main.py to use the new CLI module

9. Consistent Time Representation
   - Updated all time representations to use datetime objects instead of minutes
   - Modified relevant functions in utils/errand_utils.py and other modules to work with datetime objects
   - Updated algorithms/optimizer.py to work with datetime objects in constraints and objective function

10. Optimize Performance
    - Implemented caching for expensive calculations, such as travel times and errand times
    - Used functools.lru_cache for function-level caching in utils/travel_time.py and utils/errand_utils.py
    - Updated algorithms/optimizer.py to use the new cached functions and reduce redundant calculations

## Remaining Tasks

11. Further Enhance Error Handling
    - Extend enhanced error handling to optimizer.py and other remaining modules
    - Ensure consistent error handling practices across the entire codebase

12. Expand Test Coverage
    - Implement integration tests to ensure different components work correctly together
    - Use pytest fixtures to set up test data and environments
    - Add more comprehensive unit tests for optimizer.py and other modules

13. GUI Improvements
    - Update GUI components to work with the new datetime representations
    - Enhance user experience with more intuitive controls and visualizations
    - Implement real-time updates for optimization progress

14. Performance Profiling and Optimization
    - Use profiling tools to identify remaining performance bottlenecks
    - Optimize critical paths in the code based on profiling results
    - Consider implementing parallel processing for independent calculations

15. Documentation Update
    - Update all documentation to reflect recent changes and optimizations
    - Create a comprehensive API documentation for all modules
    - Improve inline comments for complex algorithms and data structures

## Next Steps

1. Further Enhance Error Handling (Task 11)
   - Extend enhanced error handling to optimizer.py and other remaining modules
   - Ensure consistent error handling practices across the entire codebase

2. Expand Test Coverage (Task 12)
   - Implement integration tests for key components
   - Add more unit tests for optimizer.py and other critical modules
   - Set up pytest fixtures for common test scenarios

3. GUI Improvements (Task 13)
   - Update GUI to work with new datetime representations
   - Implement real-time optimization progress updates

After completing these tasks, we'll reassess the project's state and prioritize the remaining items.

Remember to update the developer log as you complete each task, noting any challenges faced and decisions made during the implementation.
