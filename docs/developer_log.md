9. Improved GUI navigation and Problem Definition Tab
10. Implemented Systems Engineering Framework
11. Updated Project Documentation for Systems Engineering Framework
12. Implemented Greedy Schedule Visualizer
13. Implemented Greedy Schedule Visualization Tab
14. Fixed Travel Time Plotting in Greedy Schedule Visualizer
15. Fixed Gaps Between Errands in Greedy Scheduler
16. Fixed CP-SAT Solver Not Improving on Initial Greedy Schedule
17. Implemented Contractor Schedules Tab
18. Removed File-based Logging and Transitioned to Console-only Logging
19. Implemented Contractor Calendar Feature
20. Completed Contractor Calendar Feature Implementation
21. Fixed Overlapping Errands in Greedy Scheduler
22. Implemented and Updated Scheduling Utility Functions
23. Updated code to use datetime consistently throughout
24. Implemented MasterContractorCalendar
25. Updated System Engineering Documentation for MasterContractorCalendar
26. Finalized MasterContractorCalendar Implementation and Documentation
27. Implemented Proper Time Slots for Scheduling in Contractor Calendars, but contractor scheduling is still not working properly. Contractor calendars result in no availability on any days for any errands.
28. Implemented calendar initialization improvement:
    - Created utils/calendar_initialization.py with initialize_calendars function
    - Updated gui/greedy_solution_tab.py to use initialize_calendars and pass master calendar to initial_greedy_schedule
    - Modified algorithms/initial_greedy_scheduler.py to accept master calendar as parameter and use it throughout scheduling process
29. Extended calendar initialization improvement:
    - Updated algorithms/CP_SAT_optimizer.py to accept and use the master calendar
    - Modified gui/optimized_solution_tab.py to initialize the master calendar and pass it to both initial_greedy_schedule and optimize_schedule functions
    - Ensured consistent use of master calendar throughout the scheduling and optimization process
30. Fixed calendar initialization issues:
    - Updated utils/calendar_initialization.py to create ContractorCalendar instances without passing contractor objects
    - Modified models/master_contractor_calendar.py to add contractor calendars using contractor IDs
    - Ensured consistent usage of contractor IDs when interacting with the master calendar in all relevant files
31. Implemented Initial Master Contractor Schedule (IMCS) tab:
    - Created new file gui/imcs_tab.py with IMCSTab class
    - Added IMCS tab to main_frame.py
    - Updated problem_generation_tab.py to enable the "Initialize Calendars" button in IMCS tab when a new problem is generated
    - Modified greedy_solution_tab.py and optimized_solution_tab.py to use the master calendar from IMCS tab
    - Implemented error handling and warnings for proper tab navigation in main_frame.py
32. Fixed IMCS tab integration issues:
    - Updated main_frame.py to pass problem_generation_tab to IMCSTab constructor
    - Modified imcs_tab.py to accept problem_generation_tab in constructor and use it directly
    - Ensured proper error handling when accessing contractors in IMCS tab
33. Improved datetime consistency across the application:
    - Updated imcs_tab.py to use datetime objects for both days and time slots
    - Modified contractor_calendar.py to improve the is_available method for better compatibility with the IMCS tab
    - Verified that calendar_initialization.py is compatible with the changes and uses datetime objects correctly

## Next Steps

34. Implement test plan for IMCS tab and integration:
    a. Test problem generation:
       - Generate problems with different numbers of customers and contractors
       - Verify that contractors are correctly created and stored
    b. Test calendar initialization:
       - Initialize calendars for generated contractors
       - Verify that the master calendar contains the correct number of contractor calendars
       - Check that each contractor calendar has the correct number of days and time slots
    c. Test IMCS tab functionality:
       - Verify that the "Initialize Calendars" button is initially disabled
       - Generate a problem and check that the button becomes enabled
       - Click the "Initialize Calendars" button and verify that the grid is populated correctly
       - Check that the grid displays the correct number of contractors and time slots
       - Verify that the availability status (color coding) is correct for each cell
    d. Test integration with other tabs:
       - Verify that the "Generate Greedy Solution" button is enabled after calendar initialization
       - Generate a greedy solution and check that it respects the availability in the master calendar
       - Optimize the solution and verify that it also respects the master calendar
    e. Test error handling:
       - Attempt to initialize calendars without generating a problem first
       - Try to generate a greedy solution without initializing calendars
       - Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed
    f. Performance testing:
       - Generate large problems (e.g., 100+ contractors) and measure the time taken for calendar initialization
       - Check the responsiveness of the IMCS tab when displaying large grids
