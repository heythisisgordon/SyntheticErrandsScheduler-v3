- Implemented comprehensive type hinting throughout the entire project

## Recent Development Log
1. Implemented consistent time representation using datetime objects
2. Fixed time representation issues and improved error handling
3. Updated Errand model to handle both datetime and date objects
4. Updated GUI components for integer and datetime-based day representations
5. Implemented Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Solver and optimizer selection
6. Implemented optimizer selection in CLI mode
7. Renamed Initial Scheduler to Initial Greedy Scheduler
8. Implemented general optimizer call and renamed CP-SAT Optimizer
9. Improved GUI navigation and Problem Definition Tab
10. Implemented Systems Engineering Framework
11. Updated Project Documentation for Systems Engineering Framework
12. Implemented Greedy Schedule Visualizer
13. Implemented Greedy Schedule Visualization Tab
14. Fixed Travel Time Plotting in Greedy Schedule Visualizer
15. Fixed Gaps Between Errands in Greedy Scheduler
16. Fixed CP-SAT Solver Not Improving on Initial Greedy Schedule
17. Implemented Contractor Schedules Tab
18. Removed File-based Logging and Transitioned to Console-only Logging
19. Implemented Contractor Calendar Feature
20. Completed Contractor Calendar Feature Implementation
21. Fixed Overlapping Errands in Greedy Scheduler
22. Implemented and Updated Scheduling Utility Functions
23. Updated code to use datetime consistently throughout
24. Implemented MasterContractorCalendar
25. Updated System Engineering Documentation for MasterContractorCalendar
26. Finalized MasterContractorCalendar Implementation and Documentation
27. Implemented Proper Time Slots for Scheduling in Contractor Calendars, but contractor scheduling is still not working properly. Contractor calendars result in no availability on any days for any errands.

## Next Steps
1. Create code branch that focuses development on proper greedy algorithm function. This will include removal of many elements beyond the greedy scheduler, especially those that take up a lot of memory when using AI tools. Suggest deletion of:
  - all code tests (complete)
  - systems engineering documentation (complete)
  - vehicle routing optimizer (complete)
  - Tab 7 (visualization tab) (complete)
  - command line interface (complete)
  Code should be reviewed fully to remove any references/dependencies related to these functions. CP-SAT Optimization functionality SHOULD BE RETAINED as a basic next-step for development once the greedy scheduler is operating properly. (complete)

  2. Clean up the code
  - remove unnecessarily verbose commenting
  - add brief (in-line or 1 separate line) comments to uncommented sections of code
  - add brief (less than 3 lines) comments to files without any introductory comments at the top of the file
  - remove redundant logging
  - organize utility functions logically
  - rename files to clearly and unambiguously indicate their function
  - remove or rework redundant functions
  - implement new utility functions where needed
