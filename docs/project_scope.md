Project Scope: Synthetic Errands Scheduler v3

Objective:
Develop a modular and maintainable Synthetic Errands Scheduler that addresses the basic case of a greedy scheduler where customers are assigned to the first available contractor. The scheduler should incorporate centralized configuration for improved consistency and ease of modification. The code should use the Single Responsibility Principle and Don't Repeat Yourself Principle, with emphasis on modularity and maintainability. Implement a robust systems engineering framework to ensure a comprehensive and well-documented approach to the project.

In-Scope:
1. Modular project structure with separate directories for models, utils, algorithms, and GUI components
2. Representation of Busyville as a 100x100 grid with roads
3. Comprehensive data structures for errands, contractors, and customers
4. Travel time calculation using road-based routing
5. Generation of random problem instances with customizable number of customers and contractors
6. Greedy algorithm for initial scheduling in a separate module
7. Console output and GUI display of the initial schedule and profits
8. Detailed visualization of the schedule and city layout
9. Comprehensive unit test suite for all major components
10. User input for problem parameters via GUI
11. Centralized constants file (constants.py) for improved maintainability, including:
    - Errand types and their characteristics
    - Working hours and scheduling period
    - Default problem generation parameters
    - Incentive and disincentive rules
12. Consistent use of centralized constants across all modules
13. Detailed logging of scheduling decisions and profit calculations
14. Improved travel time consideration in initial scheduling
15. Implementation of comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase for improved readability and maintainability
16. Improved GUI navigation with informative warnings instead of restrictive error messages
17. Ability to set longer Base Time values (up to 480 minutes) for errand types
18. Disincentive fields added for all errand types
19. New "Commit Changes Temporarily" button in the Problem Definition tab
20. Implementation of a comprehensive systems engineering framework, including:
    - Requirements Specification Document (RSD)
    - System Architecture Document
    - Traceability Matrix
    - Test Plan
    - Interface Control Document (ICD)
    - Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
    - Use Case Diagram and Descriptions
    - Sequence Diagrams
    - Risk Management Plan
    - Project Plan
21. Contractor calendar functionality for managing contractor availability and assignments

Out-of-Scope:
1. Real-time traffic considerations
2. Multiple optimization objectives
3. Persistent data storage
4. Performance optimizations for large-scale problems (>100 customers or >10 contractors)

Constraints:
- Must complete scheduling within a 14-day period
- Must adhere to contractor working hours (8am to 5pm)
- Same-day incentives must be capped at 1.5x the base rate
- Scheduling must respect contractor calendar availability

Deliverables:
1. Functional Python program implementing the scheduler with a modular structure
2. Systems Engineering documents:
    a. Requirements Specification Document (RSD)
    b. System Architecture Document
    c. Traceability Matrix
    d. Test Plan
    e. Interface Control Document (ICD)
    f. Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
    g. Use Case Diagram and Descriptions
    h. Sequence Diagrams
    i. Risk Management Plan
    j. Project Plan

Note: This program emphasizes a modular approach to software design and provides a user-friendly interface, allowing for easier maintenance, testing, and future enhancements. The program uses centralized constants to ensure consistency across the application and simplify future modifications to errand types, incentives, and other key parameters. This approach significantly improves the maintainability of the project by reducing the need for changes across multiple files when updating core algorithms or configuration settings. The program uses comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase to enable code readability, help catch potential type-related bugs earlier, and enhance overall maintainability.

This program is founded on a comprehensive systems engineering framework to ensure a well-documented and structured approach to the project. This framework provides a solid foundation for understanding the system requirements, architecture, and interactions, facilitating better communication among team members and stakeholders. It also supports traceability, testing, and risk management throughout the project lifecycle, contributing to the overall quality and reliability of the Synthetic Errands Scheduler system.
