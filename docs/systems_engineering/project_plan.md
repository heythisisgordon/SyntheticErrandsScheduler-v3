# Project Plan for Synthetic Errands Scheduler System

## 1. Introduction

This Project Plan outlines the approach for developing the Synthetic Errands Scheduler System as part of a master's program capstone project. The project aims to design and implement a scheduler for Synthetic Errands Inc. to maximize revenue by optimizing the scheduling of errands considering staff availability, errand priorities, and costs.

## 2. Project Overview

- **Project Title**: Scheduling for Profit Optimization
- **Project Duration**: Mid-August 2024 to Mid-December 2024
- **Team Members**: Fatima Alarcon, Gordon Banks, Abigail Matingly, Kaleb Vierra
- **Sponsor**: Maximus

### 2.1 Problem Statement

Synthetic Errands Inc. faces challenges in optimizing their scheduling process to maximize revenue while considering various constraints such as contractor availability, errand types, and customer requirements. The current approach uses simple calendar-based scheduling, which is inefficient and leads to missed opportunities for profit optimization.

### 2.2 Project Objectives

1. Design and implement a scheduler that maximizes revenue for Synthetic Errands Inc.
2. Optimize scheduling considering staff availability, errand priorities, and costs.
3. Develop a scalable system that can accommodate the addition of new job types, contractors, and constraints.
4. Implement and compare multiple scheduling algorithms, including basic, moderate, and advanced approaches.
5. Create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the scheduling system.

## 3. Systems Engineering Approach

This project will follow a comprehensive systems engineering approach, emphasizing the following elements:

### 3.1 Requirements Engineering

- Develop and maintain a Requirements Specification Document (RSD)
- Conduct stakeholder analysis to ensure all perspectives are considered
- Implement requirements traceability throughout the project lifecycle

### 3.2 System Architecture

- Create a detailed System Architecture Document
- Develop Use Case Diagrams and Descriptions
- Implement Data Flow Diagrams to illustrate system interactions

### 3.3 Interface Control

- Develop an Interface Control Document (ICD) to define system interfaces
- Ensure proper integration between system components and external systems

### 3.4 Risk Management

- Implement a comprehensive Risk Management Plan
- Regularly assess and mitigate project risks

### 3.5 Verification and Validation

- Develop a Test Plan incorporating both automated and manual testing approaches
- Implement traceability between requirements and test cases

## 5. Development Approach

### 5.1 Parallel Development Paths

The project will employ two parallel development paths:

1. **Manual Development Approach**: Traditional software development methodologies will be used to implement the core functionality of the Synthetic Errands Scheduler.

2. **LLM-Assisted Development Approach**: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to complement the manual coding process, create reusable code elements, and establish a framework for development.

### 5.2 Integration of Approaches

The LLM-assisted development will complement the manual coding approach by:

- Generating code and basic architectures that can be reused by the manual coding approach
- Assisting in the creation of documentation and comments
- Providing suggestions for optimization and best practices
- Helping to identify potential issues and edge cases

The development team will carefully review and integrate LLM-generated code into the main codebase, ensuring quality and consistency.

## 6. Project Timeline
