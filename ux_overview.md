User Experience Overview

The Synthetic Errands Scheduler v2 is designed with simplicity in mind. 
It operates as a command-line application with no graphical user interface.

User Interaction:
1. The user runs the program by executing the main.py file.
2. The program automatically generates a problem instance, creates an 
   initial schedule, and optimizes it.
3. Results are displayed in the console, showing:
   - The final schedule for each day
   - Total profit achieved
4. A visualization of the schedule is saved as "schedule_visualization.png"

The user does not need to provide any input or make any decisions during 
the execution of the program. This design allows for quick and easy 
testing of the scheduling algorithm's performance.

Future enhancements may include:
- Command-line arguments for customizing problem parameters
- Interactive mode for step-by-step execution and analysis
- Web-based graphical interface for easier visualization and interaction
